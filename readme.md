# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

To setup the repo first you need to setup the codespace following this link https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=561449592. In the codespace terminal type the command `docker-compose up`. Click on the browser links that appear in the terminal starting with the public backend to make sure the sever is working then the public frontend.
